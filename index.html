    <p id="announcement-text"><b>ANNOUNCEMENT: </b>It has come to my attention that someone is posting under my name on forums. So beware. I almost never post on forums. The only forum I have posted on this year is <b>Cutting through the Fog</b>. Also, someone was pretending to be me on Twitter. I have no Twitter account and never have had one. I am also not on Facebook or any other social media. I am not posting videos on Youtube. Also, the search engines are leading with pics of someone else when you search on me. See my front page for pics of me. The hideous smoking monster at Youtube is not me. So why is Google leading with pics of this trolldoll when you search on me? And why are so many Intel-front sites running projects against me leading with photos of him? I think you know why. He was created for just that purpose. Apparently no one is buying it: American Loons runs his picture tagged as me above a pathetic and content-free hit piece—the article has two comments in six months, one of them negative. We just got 3000 comments in a few weeks over at Cutting, 99% of them positive.</p>
    <p id="announcement-text">Also, the guy Goldstein at Twitter and elsewhere is not me. I have no connection to him and wish he would stop implying there is a connection.</p>

    <p id="blurb">I emerge from my binge reading of Mathis—artist, physics bad boy, cultural critic, and constant exposer of spooks—with every surety of my youth dispelled by his X-ray vision. Using extensive genealogy from mainstream sources, expert deconstruction of faked news photos, and persuasive logic bolstered by straight-up honesty of method and intent, with a charming way of presenting strong opinions as nothing other than personal speculation, Mathis has caused the house of cards to fall all around me.</p>

    <p id="update-links"><b>NEW PAPER,</b> added 6/26/23, <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/barnfire.pdf" target="_blank"><i>The Fake Texas Barn Fire.</i></a> Sherlock does this one.</p>
    <p id="update-links"><b>OLD PAPER, </b>added 10/2/18, <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/titan.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Titanic: the Fraud that Keeps Giving.</i></a> I am top-listing this old paper, for obvious reasons. I already proved there is no ship down there, so we know the new events are faked like the old ones. They made up this story to try to resell the old one, but it isn't working very well. It is falling apart in all the usual ways. I have tacked on a few new comments at the end.</p>
    <p id="update-links"><b>NEW PAPER,</b> added 6/19/23, <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/doll.pdf" target="_blank"><i>It's About to Get even Weirder.</i></a> Life-like silicone dolls will go mainstream.</p>
